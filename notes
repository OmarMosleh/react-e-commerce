You can use Materal UI v5 for reactjs 18
https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/

OR

There is another way to make MUI work with Reactjs is to degrade the version of react to 17.

You just need to degrade react version and react-dom version to 17 to make it work.

Check your package.json file there you will find react and react-dom version to 18 you have to degrade the version to make mui v4 work with Reactjs.

Use --force flag while degrading to version 17

OR if you don't want to degrade your react 18 to 17 then follow the below instruction.

For react >= 17.0.0 and react-dom >= 17.0.0 Use MUI v5.

If you are using react version greater than 17 you must install Material UI (version) v5.

Note: if anyhow MUI v5 does not work with react@17.0.x then install MUI (version) v4.

npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
AND

For react >= 16.8.0 and react-dom >= 16.8.0 then use this.

// with npm
npm install @material-ui/core

// with yarn
yarn add @material-ui/core
